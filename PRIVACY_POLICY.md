# Privacy Policy

Samuel Ivarsson built the Widget - Snabbsaldo app as a free app. This SERVICE is provided by Samuel Ivarsson at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the use and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decides to use my Service.

If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy.

## Information Collection and Use

The app does use third party services that collect information used to identify you. The Personal Information that the app uses is only handled by Swedbank's API and I do not collect any information about you. To make the app work, you will be required to log in using you personal identity number and your Mobile BankID. No other authentication method is supported. This information is only stored on your device and is sent directly to Swedbank's API.

## Cookies

Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.

This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app uses third party code and libraries (Swedbank's API) that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. 

## Security

No method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update my Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
